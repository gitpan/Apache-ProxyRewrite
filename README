Apache::ProxyRewrite acts as a reverse-proxy that will rewrite
URLs embedded in HTML documents per apache configuration
directives.
 
This module was written to allow multiple backend services with
discrete URLs to be presented as one service and to allow the
proxy to do authentication on the client's behalf.

See ProxyRewrite.pm pod for detailed documentation.
